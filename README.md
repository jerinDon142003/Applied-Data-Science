# 🧠 Complete Data Science Workflow Project

Welcome to the **Complete Data Science Process** repository!  
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow starting from data collection to advanced machine learning techniques with model evaluation. It is designed to guide data enthusiasts through real-world data handling, visualization, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository covers the **entire data science lifecycle**, including:

1. **📥 Data Collection**
   - Loading data from **local files** using Python (CSV, Excel, etc.)
   - **Web scraping** using libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `Selenium` to collect data from websites

2. **🧹 Data Exploration & Preparation**
   - Handling missing values and duplicates
   - Removing irrelevant or redundant data
   - Converting data types and creating new features
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3. **📊 Visual Analytics**
   - Identifying **outliers and patterns** using:
     - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (box plots, pair plots, histograms, etc.)
     - `plotly` for interactive charts
   - **Folium** maps to visualize **locations on interactive maps**

4. **📈 Interactive Dashboarding**
   - Created a **Plotly Dash app** for interactive data visualization
   - Dynamic filtering, graph updates, and map plotting using Plotly and Dash

5. **🤖 Machine Learning Models**
   - Trained and tested various models:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Decision Tree**
     - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - Performed model evaluation using:
     - Accuracy score
     - Confusion matrix
     - Classification report

6. **🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Used `GridSearchCV` to find the **best model parameters**
   - Calculated and compared model performance using cross-validation
